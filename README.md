# baseplate-go

Heavily inspired by [reddit's
baseplate.py](https://github.com/reddit/baseplate.py), a service library for
internal stratos.host services that helps:

- initialize opentelemetry providers (tracing, logging, metrics)

This work is very early and likely to change rapidly. Future work will [expand the concerns of the libary](https://github.com/bloominlabs/hostin-proj/issues/285).
